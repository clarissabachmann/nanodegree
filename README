  Business Questions to be answered
  The following investigation investigates factors that could be used in the pricing of properties. Pricing in AirBnbs is an 
  important topic as AirBnbs are often used either for short term cheap housing or as a cheaper alternative than a hotel.
  Having more awareness about how properties are priced and general pricing trends in cities will allow for future properties to
  be appropriately priced but also allow for cities to be marketed to the appropriate clientelle. The following three questions
  will be investigated:
  1. Do ratings influence price in Seatle and Boston? Are more highly rated properties more expensive? Do owners increase their prices after
  having received high ratings from guests?
    This question is to be investigated because logic would suggest that a more highly rated property would be more likely to 
    be chosen and hosts could increase the price and still have guests as people are more likely to select higher properties
    with higher ratings.
  2. Do number of bedrooms, bathrooms, or number of guests that a property can accommodate influence price in Boston 
  or Seatle? It is assumed that the size of a property would effect its price, can the data be used to corroborate 
  this?
    A further factor that would logically lead to an increase in price would be increased number of rooms, or number of guests
    a property can accommodate would influence price. Naturally the more guests a property can accommodate comfortably the
    larger this property would be and therefore more expensive. Also factors like number of bedrooms and number of bathrooms
    would influence how comfortably a larger number of guests a property could accommodate and therefore also increase the price.
  3. Overall do Seatle and Boston differ in prices? Is a certain city more expensive in general? Should either city
  be marketed to different clientelle?
    Looking into the difference in prices will allow us to understand whether either city has a tendency to be more expensive 
    and use this to influence what kind of guests each city is marketed to as certain guests will be more able to pay higher
    prices than others.
    
Initial investigation of the data
The first steps are too look at the data and what possible columns could be used to answer the questions we've asked.
Since all the questions we've asked are regarding price, the price columns were selected. Looking at the number of
nulls in monthly_price and weekly_price suggests that these columns would just limit the number of rows we could actually use
in our investigation so the those rows will be dropped and just use the price column (imputating null values does not make sense
in this case due to the high volume of nulls and reliance of price on other factors that would complicate accurate imputation). 
The price column also will further cleansing as there are characters (including, and $) that will need to be removed in order
to assign the appropriate datatype. Further columns will be question specific.

Question 1: Looking through the list of columns need to include all columns that are related directly to ratings, which includes
an overall rating value and 6 sub-ratings, and the price column. All these are rated on a 1-10 basis making further analysis simple and not requiring
the need to work with categorical data. The few number of nulls mean that columns with nulls can just be dropped as there
is plenty of data remaining after this occurs and limits the effect that imputing data could have on the accuracy of our results

Question 2: Once again similar to question 1 the necessary columns need to be selected out which include any columns related to
bedrooms, number of guests a property can accommodate, number of bathrooms, and price. Number bedrooms and bathrooms are included
because while the overall number or guests a property can accommodate gives a rough estimate of size the number of bedrooms and
bathrooms influence how comfortably each of these accommodated guests can stay in a property (each guest would have more space
and fewer people to share a bathroom) and would intuitively increase the price of the property. Again due to the low number of 
nulls these rows were dropped from further analysis.

Question 3: For the final question few columns are required mainly the cleaned up price column from each location and the 
accommodates columns. The accommodates column is included as in order to do further investigation between the cities properties
between properties that are or similar sizes and can accommodate similar number of guests. 

Modeling

For Questions 1 and 2 a similar modeling approach will be taken. Initially descriptive statistics will be looked at to get a
general overview of the data prior to correlating the ratings or rooms. Following this linear regressions will be used to see
if either ratings or rooms can be used to predict the price. The effectiveness of these models will be judged on their R squared
values.

For Question 3 a different approach will be taken where the means of each group (Boston and Seatle) are statistically compared 
using independent groups T-test first as a whole and then in different groupings based on the number of guests a property can 
accommodate.
